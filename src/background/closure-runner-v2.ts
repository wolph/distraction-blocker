/**
 * The closure journal. This file owns the two durable writes that end a session and the cleanup
 * attempts that follow them: `prepared` freezes the logical end while the session is still durable,
 * and one checkpoint commits that end and installs the browser cleanup the closure still owes.
 *
 * The split from `transition-cleanup-v2.ts` is by journal, not by behavior. A transition that must
 * close a session captures its closure and hands it off inside its own cleanup; a session that ends
 * with no transition in flight comes through here. Both produce the same `cleanup` closure row, so
 * the attempt, retry, and removal rules below are the only ones the runtime ever applies to it.
